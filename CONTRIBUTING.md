# Contributing

Currently this project is a one-person-show. I'd like very much to change that.

Contributions are very welcome. You'll be credited in the change log or other 
relevant channels.

Please use a pull request for contributing. You may also open an issue to discuss
the changes.

## Development setup

Make sure that you have the dev-dependencies installed. This should happen 
automatically.

Make sure you have PHPUnit installed, preferably in the „Current Stable Version“.

## Guidelines

Don't feel intimidated by these guidelines. Chances are that your patch will
be accepted even if you don't adhere to all of them.

 - In case your patch changes documented syntax or behaviour, please also change
   the README.md
 - Please always change the CHANGELOG.md when you are making significant changes
 - Please document your code with PHPDoc syntax and in english language
 - Your patch should not break existing tests (Testing is done via PHPUnit and 
   Travis)
 - While supplying tests with your code is very much appreciated, it is not
   required

## Communication

Public communication should be done in 
[issues](https://github.com/broeser/feeld/issues). Issues don't have to be 
about bugs. Feel free to request features, praise the software, criticise it, 
ask support questions or ask about this contributing document in an issue.

If you are interested in private communication (e.g. security notices or job 
offers), you may send me an email: mail@benedictroeser.de
